# Periocular_Recognition_in_the_Visible_Spectrum
The periocular region refers to the area around the eye that may include eyebrows, eyelashes, eyelids,  shape of the eye, height, texture of the skin, eye width, etc. It is considered that only these features  are accessible due to occlusions in the input image. The model aims to work with and provide  optimum results with the minimal feature information available and perform recognition.
